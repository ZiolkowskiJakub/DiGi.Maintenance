# Audits the build output of every deployed DiGi host for assembly references that cannot be
# resolved at runtime.
#
# DiGi repositories reference each other with <Reference><HintPath>..\..\X\bin\X.dll</HintPath>
# instead of <ProjectReference>. A raw assembly reference is opaque to NuGet, so a library's
# transitive NuGet dependencies never reach a host that consumes it by HintPath, and the DiGi class
# libraries do not copy their own NuGet dependencies into their bin either. The host builds clean,
# the test suite passes, and the assembly is simply absent at runtime.
#
# The failure is not a crash. FileNotFoundException is thrown per item deep inside a loop, so a run
# completes and reports success while silently producing less than it should. This script is the
# check that catches it before a deployment does.
#
# Requires a prior build - it inspects compiled output, not project files. Run BuildAll.ps1 first
# (or BuildAll.ps1 -CheckDependencies, which calls this script for you).
