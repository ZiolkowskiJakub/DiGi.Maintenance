<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Regenerates the '.agents' rules and skills of every DiGi repository from the canonical AI Guidelines.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. Copies 'DiGi.Maintenance/.agents/AGENTS.md' (the reference rules file) into every 'DiGi.*' repository.
    2. Turns every guideline in 'DiGi.Maintenance/documentation/AI Guidelines' (except README.md) into a
       '.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md' with YAML frontmatter.
    3. Optionally refreshes an external, machine-global AGENTS.md whose path is configured as
       GLOBAL_AGENTS_FILE in 'user files/Directories.conf'. Everything up to and including the
       '## Summary of Core Coding & Testing Guidelines' heading is preserved; the compiled guidelines follow.
    4. Commits the change in every repository that has a .git directory, unless -NoCommit is specified.

    All generated files are written as UTF-8 without BOM using CRLF line endings.

.PARAMETER NoCommit
    If specified, files are updated but no git commit is created.

.PARAMETER Message
    Commit message used when committing updated '.agents' folders.

Also covers measuring a benchmark Fact in isolation (a figure read off a full-suite run is contaminated by xUnit parallel collections and is not comparable to an isolated one), opening a defect fix with a Fact that reproduces the reported symptom on the unmodified code, and proving a kept fallback unreachable before deleting it. Also covers making sure both sides of an A/B ran the intended binary (a Debug/Release mismatch in bin, a scratch harness copying its HintPath dll at its own build time, a cp/mv-restored file keeping its old mtime so the incremental build skips it - build --no-incremental then dotnet test --no-build), asymmetric fixtures for orientation facts (a rectangle mirrors onto itself), phantom Test Explorer entries persisted in .vs/.../TestStore after a rename, and the WPF off-screen render harness (Measure/Arrange/RenderTargetBitmap, pump the dispatcher, walk the visual tree rather than only screenshotting)."

    "coding-browser-testing"         = "Use when verifying interactive front-end behaviour in a real browser instead of only static code inspection - Playwright (Python) driving an installed Chromium-based browser headless (e.g. Microsoft Edge) to test panel toggles, drag-resize with min/max clamps, keyboard operability, localStorage persistence, responsive stacking and shared header/footer collapse, and verifying rendered output by screenshot statistics and GPU timer queries rather than by state flags. Also covers the hidden attribute losing to any author display rule (a transparent overlay still swallowing pointer events; check document.elementFromPoint). Confirm the toolchain on THIS machine first (availability is per-machine), and run with the host shell, never the isolated sandbox."
    "coding-deployed-webapi"         = "Use when verifying a client or server change against the live WebAPI at api.digiproject.uk - swagger as the source of truth (fetch the per-prefix document /swagger/<prefix>/swagger.json, or one operation out of it, rather than the full one to keep context small), the county to reference to building GET test recipe, access rules and gotchas. Adds triage: a uniform 000 from a sweep is a client bug until proven otherwise (CRLF id lists make malformed URLs - normalise and print %{time_total}), and a hung API is told from a UI regression with one /information/health timing call. Manual curl checks only, never added to DiGi.Test."

Also the name-resolution traps that refuse to compile (an extension cannot reuse a property name on its receiver - CS1955; a method shadows a same-named namespace in expression position - CS0119; Razor views have no enclosing DiGi.* namespace), no caching in an optimization unless the request explicitly allows it, the build-time symptoms of HintPath opacity (CS0012 fixed in the .csproj, a CS0246 wall that vanishes under -m:1, a HintPath probing the whole bin closure), never printing a user files/ conf until the redaction is proven, and the DiGi serializer traps (setters run in JSON document order; same-named members de-duplicate with the derived one winning; a base private set is skipped on derived deserialization; byte[] is a number array; Clone is a JSON round trip)."

Also the nested Subdivision layer (404 of 406 county parts): subdivision_id is the smallest containing subdivision and a per-building key, the buildings of a subdivision are read by its polygon, a municipality is never a sum over nested subdivisions, and a building occupancy share comes from the smallest figured container. Also why a spatial read pruned to an id from a subdivision/code resolve can silently empty (prune by every sibling part sharing the code) and why a building_data fill rate is not usable data (compare the distribution's exact zeros with -Distribution -All)."

Also whole-partition reads of wide tables in physical order with bounded ctid windows (Tid Range Scan, REPEATABLE READ for an exact walk), the Main vs Storage database split (no join across them), running a skipped integration fact with the confs beside the executing assembly, and NULL in a resolved-later column meaning ""unknown"" (filter sources, COALESCE the update, grep every sibling upsert)."

    "coding-webapi-contracts"        = "Use when changing a WebAPI controller's route, parameter names or validation, or when writing or maintaining an HTTP client of one - why a renamed query parameter breaks clients with no compile error and no runtime error (ASP.NET silently ignores an unknown parameter and returns the unfiltered result), the binding traps where an omitted parameter keeps default(T) and an enum sentinel that is not 0 makes the obvious guard dead code, sending enum values as integers, the client base-URI constant and /Query plumbing pattern, gating an endpoint that is not deployed yet, and the three controller-side defects (exactly one public constructor - a second one 500s every action via ActivatorUtilities; DiGi objects returned as Content(Core.Convert.ToSystem_String(x), ""application/json"") rather than Ok(x); no action-level [Produces] over string-bodied error paths, where 406 masks the error) plus the timeout layering (PostOptions.Delay 20 s per attempt, HttpClient.Timeout >= server commandtimeout)."

Completing or closing an issue, or a general 'commit and push', never triggers it: the work goes on the active version branch and the bump is offered on request."
    "github-issues"                  = "Use when querying, filtering, creating, managing, commenting on, or closing GitHub issues/PRs - filtering issues by labels via FilterIssues.ps1 to reduce token usage, avoiding PowerShell pipeline decoding mangling on existing issue bodies via dedicated Python scripts, verifying an issue's stated premises against the code before implementing it (including that a feature said to 'already work' produces observable output), mandatory Type, Priority and AI Complexity labels plus default assignee (ZiolkowskiJakub) on all new issues, mandatory --body-file usage, blocking relationships as GitHub issue dependencies (gh api .../dependencies/blocked_by, cross-repository, set when the blocker is filed and verified with the blocking GET), GraphQL revision recovery, and filing server-side production runs/deploys/re-derivations as their own follow-up issue with a blocked_by dependency (the code issue closes on its own)."

    "github-plan-files"              = "Use when an implementation plan exists or a commit/push is about to happen in a DiGi repository - plans live in the local plans folder outside the working tree, a pre-commit sweep keeps plan/scratch *.md out of every commit and push, and the default action is deleting the temporary implementation plan in the same session the issue closes (no archiving into the repo; explicit user instruction wins)."
